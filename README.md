# Bleeding TODO

This is a simple TODO list app that I built because I wanted to test out Gleam and Svelte. It's a
monorepo, where the [backend](https://github.com/henriquecbuss/bleeding-todo/tree/main/backend)
is written in [Gleam](https://gleam.run), and the
[frontend](https://github.com/henriquecbuss/bleeding-todo/tree/main/frontend) is written in
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

The backend is deployed on [Fly](https://fly.io) and uses their Postgres offering, while the frontend
is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). You can use the live version at [bleeding-todo.vercel.app](https://bleeding-todo.vercel.app).
